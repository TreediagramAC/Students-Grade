# Students-Grade
CSE232 Project1

Here is the project description.

For this project, you will be writing a simple program (project1.cpp) to calculate the grade of a student in this class. For details on how grades are assigned see the syllabus (attached in ending). The program prompts the user for 4 pieces of information, the exam score, the pre-lab subtotal (assume only the top ten scores were tallied), the project subtotal, and the number of labs failed (due to absence or poor participation).
It then reports the point total, the grade (as determined by the point total), whether the student failed enough labs to warrant a penalty, whether the student is not allowed to pass due to too few points (see "Requirements To Receive A Passing Grade"), and their final grade.
To pass the test cases, your project's output must be character-for-character correct. Also, you are not allowed to use the words "true" or "false" anywhere in your file. I recommend watching the last video of Week01 if this seems challenging.
Lastly, to implement this project, you need to know about if statements.
If you have the boolean variable "should_print", and you what to print the string "Hi" if the variable is true, in Python it looks like this:
 
if should_print:
    print("Hi")
 
In C++ it look like this:
 
if (should_print) {
    cout << "Hi" << endl;
}
 
The parentheses and curly brackets are required. 


Syllabus:

Grading
There will be 1000 points distributed thoughout the course via homeworks, exam and projects. There will be no extra credit points.

Points	GPA
900-1000	4.0
850-899	3.5
800-849	3.0
750-799	2.5
700-749	2.0
600-699	1.0
0-599	0.0
Requirements To Receive A Passing Grade
To be eligible to earn a non-zero grade in the course, a student normally must do ALL the following:

Earn at least 50% (300 points) of the total points on projects.
Earn at least 50% (150 points) of the total points on the final.
Important: Contact your instructor, if you have any concerns about your performance in the class.
